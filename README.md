This repository contains the code I use in my [**technical blog**](https://medium.com/@khoaguin) and [**personal website**](https://khoaguin.github.io) which focus on private and secure AI applications . Following is the list of technical articles and accompanying codes:  
1. [***Detecting Heart Abnormalities Using 1D CNN on Data You Cannot See***](https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-heart-abnormalities-using-1d-cnn-on-data-you-cannot-see-with-pysyft-735481a952d8). [`Code`](./ecg-split-1DCNN-PySyft/)
2. [***Privacy Preserving Machine Learning - Resources & Materials***](https://khoaguin.github.io/blog/ppml-resources-materials#/). [`Code`](https://github.com/khoaguin/ppml-materials)
3. [***What is Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption and Its Applications***](https://medium.com/@khoaguin/what-is-hybrid-homomorphic-encryption-and-its-applications-b0568b21954c). [`Code`](./what-is-hhe/)


I hope you find them useful. Please feel free to use. Have fun learning!
